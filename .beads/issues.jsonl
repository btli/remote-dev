Profile isolation works without breaking HOME:\n   - Create session with profile\n   - Verify user's .bashrc loaded (echo $BASH_VERSION)\n   - Verify CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR points to profile\n   - Verify HOME still points to real home\n\n4. Runtime port conflicts detected:\n   - Start a server on port 3000\n   - Create session with PORT=3000\n   - Verify runtime conflict warning returned\n\n5.
